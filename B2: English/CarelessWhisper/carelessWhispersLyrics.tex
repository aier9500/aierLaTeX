\subsubsection*{[Intro]}
Oh, woah, woah, oh-oh \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Verse 1]}
I feel so unsure \\[4pt]
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor \\[4pt]
As the music dies, something in your eyes \\[4pt]
Calls to mind a silver screen and all its sad goodbyes \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Chorus]}
I'm never gonna dance again \\[4pt]
Guilty feet have got no rhythm \\[4pt]
Though it's easy to pretend \\[4pt]
I know you're not a fool \\[4pt]
I should have known better than to cheat a friend \\[4pt]
And waste the chance that I'd been given \\[4pt]
So I'm never gonna dance again \\[4pt]
The way I danced with you, oh \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Verse 2]}
Time can never mend \\[4pt]
The careless whispers of a good friend \\[4pt]
To the heart and mind, ignorance is kind \\[4pt]
There's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Chorus]}
I'm never gonna dance again \\[4pt]
Guilty feet have got no rhythm \\[4pt]
Though it's easy to pretend \\[4pt]
I know you're not a fool \\[4pt]
I should have known better than to cheat a friend (Shoulda known better, yeah) \\[4pt]
And waste the chance that I'd been given \\[4pt]
So I'm never gonna dance again \\[4pt]
The way I danced with you, oh \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Post Chorus]}
Never without your love \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Verse 3]}
Tonight, the music seems so loud \\[4pt]
I wish that we could lose this crowd \\[4pt]
Maybe it's better this way \\[4pt]
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say \\[4pt]
We could have been so good together \\[4pt]
We could have lived this dance forever \\[4pt]
But now, who's gonna dance with me? \\[4pt]
Please stay \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Chorus]}
And I'm never gonna dance again \\[4pt]
Guilty feet have got no rhythm \\[4pt]
Though it's easy to pretend \\[4pt]
I know you're not a fool \\[4pt]
I should have known better than to cheat a friend \\[4pt]
And waste the chance that I'd been given \\[4pt]
So I'm never gonna dance again \\[4pt]
The way I danced with you, oh \\[4pt]

\subsubsection*{[Instrumental Break]} \,

\subsubsection*{[Outro]}
(Now that you're gone) Now that you're gone \\[4pt]
(Now that you're gone) Was what I did so wrong so wrong \\[4pt]
That you had to leave me alone? \\[4pt]
